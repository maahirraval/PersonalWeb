        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Maahir Raval, and I am extremely passionate about basketball and the different fundamentals you must develop to succeed in the sport. Scoring, passing, rebounding, defense are all essential to the sport.

            The Boston Celtics, my favorite team and the team I grew up watching, have one of the best histories when it comes to NBA teams. In fact they’re the reigning champions of the NBA as they won the NBA championship for the 2023-24 season.

            Especially at the pro level one of the most important elements players have is skill, height, and athleticism. Along with that NBA players must have out-of-this-world agility, speed, and split-second decision-making skills.

            Scoring is the most eye-appealing when it comes to watching the sport. There is two elements when it comes to scoring. Shooting and finishing. Whether it’s a deep three-pointer or an easy mid-range shot, basketball is more fun to watch when players are making tough shots. Steph Curry, for example, has revolutionized the game with the amount of three-pointers he takes. Now in modern basketball, more teams revolve more of their dynamic toward taking three-pointers. Finishing at the rim is also another element that fans love watching. From the exceptional layup packages that NBA players possess to the explosive dunking that’s always shown on highlight reels.

            Rebounding is another element of basketball that is honestly often underrated. On the offensive side, rebounding gives the team extra chances to score. Getting more opportunities to score means more points on the board and a better chance to win. On the flip side, for defense, it prevents the other team from getting more opportunities to score.

            Defense might be the most important element when it comes to winning basketball games. Good defense can look like forcing tough shots, steals, blocks, and also creating fast-break opportunities. There are also different team defensive strategies of basketball, like man-to-man defense and zone defense.
