        Finishing at the rim is also important when it comes to scoring. One of the best players at finishing is Kyrie Irving. He seems to make everything when contested at the rim. When it comes to dunking, which is less skillful but more eye appealing. Some of the best at this category currently, is Zach Lavine and Aaron Gordon. 

        Mid-range scoring is probably the most underrated aspect of scoring. As most NBA fans or causal fans donâ€™t pay attention to this type of scoring, at least not as much as three point scoring or finishing. One of the best in this category is Kevin Durant. Another player is who great at mid-range shooting but not widely regarded as on of the best scorers is Shaun Livingston.
