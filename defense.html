        History of Defense

        <p>
            Defense arguably is the most important element when it comes to winning basketball. When it comes to winning championships, a repetitve formula is stellar defense. As there have been teams who have won championships with an average offense. But almost never is there a championship winning team with bad defense.

            Steals and blocks are a sometimes a good indicator when it comes to which defenders are the best at defense. However, there are so much that stats don’t tell with defense. As although the best defenders usually end up with the best defensive stats, there are many great defenders who may not be as backed up as the stats. For example, stats don’t take into account a defender guarding the best offensive player on the other team. Furthermore, if a defender holds a 30 ppg (points per game) player to 20 points, that’s considered great defense. However, if another player allows a 8 ppg player to 16 points, the defender who allowed 15 points may be considered to be the better defender because he allowed less points. However, we know that’s not the case as the other defender, held to the better offensive player to stats well below his average, while the 15 points defender allowed the worse offensive player double his socring stats.
