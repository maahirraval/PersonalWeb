        History of Rebounding
    </header>


    <section>

        <p>
            Rebounding is also another fundamental aspect of basketball, as the lack of offensive rebounds means a lack of extra scoring opportunities. Lack of additional scoring opportunities makes it harder to win games. On the flip side, the more offensive rebounds a team has, the better chance they have at winning basketball games. Defensive rebounding is also key, but as praised as offensive rebounding, as teams are expected to grab rebounds on defense.
